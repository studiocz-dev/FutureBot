## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Duplicate Key Warnings
**Status:** Expected behavior, not an error

```
Error bulk inserting candles: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
```

**Explanation:** The bot tries to insert historical candles that already exist in the database. The database correctly rejects duplicates. This is normal and harmless.

**Solution:** None needed. This is proper behavior.

---

### 2. Python 3.10 vs 3.11
**Status:** Working but not optimal

**Current:** Python 3.10.6  
**Recommended:** Python 3.11+

**Impact:** Minimal. Bot works fine, but 3.11+ has better async performance.

**Solution:** Optional upgrade to Python 3.11+ when convenient.
